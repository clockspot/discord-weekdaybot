# discord-weekdaybot

What weekday is it? Wonder no longer!

* Run `bot-weekday.py` on a cron job for posting the daily weekday gif
	* e.g. `cd [dir]; python3 bot-weekday.py`
* Run `bot.py` persistently to respond to queries from users
	* e.g. `cd [dir]; nohup python3 bot.py &> weekdaybot-log.txt &`

## TODO

* Do we need the Pipfiles?
* Add more types of weeks and make it display a week at a time
